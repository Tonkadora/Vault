- **Donovich's Past**: Doru was supposed to take over the church, but he may have fallen in with a bad group, getting too close to the castle and disappearing for many days. Strahd brought him back to show him.
- **Vampire Transformation**: Strahd bit and killed Doru, and he returned as a vampire three days later. If allowed to drink human blood, Doru would become stronger, able to kill and bury within three days.

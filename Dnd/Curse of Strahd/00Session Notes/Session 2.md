## Day 2
### Arrival in Barovia

We began the day by walking into [Barovia](app://obsidian.md/Barovia), a town shrouded in mystery and danger. The west side of the town had rows of houses, with the center road leading into the town center. The town was largely abandoned, with boarded-up buildings and a general sense of sadness. There were no hedges or gates surrounding the town, and the atmosphere was eerie and foreboding.

### Encounter with Morgantha

From [Xyrlee Evihethrill](app://obsidian.md/Xyrlee%20Evihethrill)'s bird's eye view while approaching the town, we notice there is an old lady on the west side and some chimney smoke from around her area. In the center of town, there are 3 main buildings, two of which have lights on inside them (buildings 2 and 3).

As we made our way through the town, we encountered an old lady named [Morgantha](app://obsidian.md/Morgantha), who was selling a glowing silvery bottle to a local. He opened the door from where I heard shuffling from and [Morgantha](app://obsidian.md/Morgantha) gave him a vial and he provided her with blue glowing "rocks". She returned from the local and began trying to sell us her vials as well. She claimed to be a powerful wizard and traded the bottle for memories and happiness. [Morgantha](app://obsidian.md/Morgantha) warned us to go to the inn and let the magic take us, cautioning us that the school was haunted.

### Exploring the Town Center

We continued on to the town center, where we found a shop that was old, empty, and wet. The interior was cluttered and appeared to have been abandoned for some time. We also came across the [Blood of the Vine Tavern](app://obsidian.md/Blood%20of%20the%20Vine%20Tavern), where we met [Ismark Colionovich](app://obsidian.md/Ismark%20Colionovich), the current Burgermister. Ismark was the son of [Kolyan Indirovich](app://obsidian.md/Kolyan%20Indirovich), and he had a sister named [Ireena Kolyana](app://obsidian.md/Ireena%20Kolyana) who had caught the attention of [Strahd](app://obsidian.md/Strahd), a vampire who had visited the town twice.

### Meeting Ismark Indrovich

Ismark explained that vampires were undead creatures that bit to make more vampires, drank blood, and had mind control powers. He warned us to be careful around Strahd, as he was a powerful and cunning foe. We also learned that Strahd rarely visited the town, but when he did, he was always well-dressed and clean-cut.


We also learned that there were other towns nearby, including Falaki, which was located 5-6 hours walk from Barovia, and Cresk, which was a couple of days walk away.

## Encounter
### The Half-Man, Half-Mushroom Creature

As we walked with Ismark to his home, he tripped on a rock and opened a door, revealing a half-man, half-mushroom creature. It charged at us from the doorway.

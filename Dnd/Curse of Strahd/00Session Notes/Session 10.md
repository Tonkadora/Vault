Elven man steps out of a carrage( all black two black horses. ) very well kept and polished. Wayne seems to know that hes screaming or it could be the wind. Makes his way to Irwin and leans in with a soft whisper.


Calstle ravenloft is missing a shipment of wine. Wanting to know what is the hold up. Inn keeper the roads arn't safe but assures that he will recive the shipment. Doesn't like to be left waiting. He doesn't die so it should be fine. Heard of a death "of the believers" and wants to go talk with kalista. inn keeper says it might not be the best. He says there might be some interesting books that might need transport back. 

Studied the elfs face- hes armed with daggers and spell caster book I saw 

Chamberlen for strahd (second in charge).

This temple is a two story stone building, egg shaped. north side has an attached stone building(housing for clerics ). Big arches with the main entrance open. ceiling is open to the sky. (moon god).  Floor is open and some seats around all pointing to the middle.

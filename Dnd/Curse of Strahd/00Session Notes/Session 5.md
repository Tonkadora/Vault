We beat the spider and mushroom man. We take a look around the room and find a magic rock with three eyes on it. One eye is open and the other two are closed.


We go to shop and steal the dragon book. There was a decoy at the front of the front of the store with Faye and Wayne. Xyrlee and I went around back and stole the dragon book. 

Billy had a really rough time but was the perfect decoy. 

We then went to the manor and talked with [[Ismark Colionovich]]. 

Vistani have lots of eye symbols. Ismark may have seen something like that but very vague.


Want to know a secret about something Xyrlee about his past.

Great Everwood (broad area). Remenant of the past when dragons ruled the world. Family tree is still tied there. Keep to them selfs keep their blade singing to themselves. Many dangers that live near by. Sword was given by mentor and aunt alariath. She taught everything she knew and pasted on the weapon. Has a huge magic aura about it. Runes light up in use and not when out of use. Green leather on the grip of the sword. 

Become unnerved as to why we left.

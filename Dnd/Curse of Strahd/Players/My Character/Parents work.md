Whatever their eye color was in life, after transformation, vampires' eyes changed to a red color that was hard to forget. Their hands ended in sharp, glassy claws. Notably, vampires possessed retractable sharp monstrous canines used to pierce the victims' flesh. When vampires were well-fed, their undead bodies' decomposition halted and was reversed

They did not cast shadows, had no reflections in mirrors, and moved in complete silence. Sages claimed vampires retained their souls after turning.

Vampires enjoyed finer things in unlife and engaged in decadent behavior, often sharing such habits with liches. A vampire was always a creature of evil. If they were not evil in life, they became so in undeath, whether they retained the memories of their mortal existence or not. Whatever attachments and affection they had towards things from their life, all were changed and corrupted by the transformation. Love was flipped to obsession, and the feelings of friendship were made into feelings of jealousy. Many vampires became obsessed and fixated on things they desired in the past – those who once sought love became predators searching for beauty in their victims, and those who valued youth could fixate on children, snuffing out the future potential of mortals at the very beginning of their journeys. These obsessions extended to possessions, as many vampires delved into collecting art, acquiring terrifying implements of torture, or decorating their lairs with trophies.

Being highly intelligent and untagging creatures, vampires forged their plans meticulously and advanced the schemes slowly, sometimes taking decades to take steps toward their goals. Vampires felt no need to rush as they could outlive their mortal enemies and spend decades or centuries planning revenge.

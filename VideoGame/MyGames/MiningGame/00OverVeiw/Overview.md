## Game Overview
### Explore
- I want a game where you go out to different zones and fight mobs collect items and discover areas 
#### Zones
- Zones will have a boss or several
- items that belong to that zone 
- enemies that belong to that zone
##### Items
- Items will be found through out the game each zone will provide new items that will be needed for making cartable tools, weapons, machines. 
- Items will  be able to combine with other items to create new items

### Base
#### Base Automation
- with new items you bring them back to base where you can build items to help progress the game more efficiently. 
	- I don't want to have to go grind an area indefinitely. 
	- Once you have an Item you can go "research it" and create a way to make said item at your base. 
#### Base Setup
- base is mob free.
	- starts out small and expands as you progress.
	- can build items to help you progress through the game.

- I would like a way for you to be able to place items through out the zone.

Here's a brief summary of each script:

### 1. Basic Enemy

* Extends `CharacterBody2D`
* Moves towards the player
* Deletes itself when colliding with the player
* Uses a hitbox to detect collisions

### 2. Sword Ability Controller

* Extends `Node`
* Has a sword ability that can be instantiated
* When the timer times out, it:
	+ Finds all enemies within a certain range of the player
	+ Sorts the enemies by distance from the player
	+ Instantiates a sword at the position of the closest enemy
	+ Gives the sword a random rotation and position offset

### 3. Main Camera

* Extends `Camera2D`
* Follows the player's position
* Smoothly moves towards the player using a lerp function
* Acquires the player's position and updates the camera's target position

### 4. Player

* Extends `CharacterBody2D`
* Moves the player based on input (arrow keys or WASD)
* Uses input actions to determine movement direction
* Sets the player's velocity based on the movement direction and speed

**Note:** The Sword Ability Controller script seems to be designed to create a sword at the position of the closest enemy when the timer times out. This could be used to create a "sword ability" that attacks the closest enemy.

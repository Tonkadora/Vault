Lyle's changeling nature allowed him to blend in and avoid the fate of many other orphans. By age 10, he had constructed his first creationâ€”a small clockwork rabbit that carried messages, becoming his closest companion.

### Cultural Legacy: Misfit Innovator

Raised without family or community, Lyle found solace among outcasts. He met Fiznik, a gnome tinkerer exiled for radical ideas, who became his mentor.

### Familial Ties and Mentorship

Though orphaned, Lyle's bond with Fiznik became like that of a father and son. This mentorship gave Lyle direction and fueled his desire to uncover the truth about his parents' disappearance.

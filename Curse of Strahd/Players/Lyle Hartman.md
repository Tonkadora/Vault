Changeling, Artificer (Battle Smith) 

Background: Orphaned Changeling 

Street Survivor and Inventor: 

Lyle’s changeling nature allowed him to blend in and avoid the fate of many other orphans. He quickly developed a knack for creating tools and gadgets out of discarded items, a skill that blossomed into a passion for inventing. By age 10, he had constructed his first creation—a small clockwork rabbit that carried messages, becoming his closest companion. His resourcefulness in a world that didn’t welcome him was the foundation of his path as an artificer. 

Cultural Legacy: Misfit Innovator 

Raised without the security of a family or community, Lyle found solace among other outcasts. He eventually met Fiznik, a gnome tinkerer exiled from his clan for his radical ideas. Fiznik took Lyle under his wing, recognizing his potential and teaching him the finer points of artificing. Together, they formed a bond through invention, with Fiznik pushing Lyle to explore new possibilities beyond mere survival. Lyle’s changeling identity made him adaptable, but it was his inventive spirit that gave him a sense of purpose and belonging. 

Familial Ties and Mentorship: 

Though his parents left him early, Lyle’s bond with Fiznik became like that of a father and son. The gnome's unorthodox ideas and rebellious approach to invention deeply influenced Lyle, encouraging him to push boundaries in his artificing, especially in the creation of mechanical companions. This mentorship gave Lyle a direction in life, but it also fueled his desire to uncover the truth behind his parents' disappearance. 

Philosophy: 

Lyle is driven by a need for self-preservation, creative expression, and the quest for truth about his lineage. He walks a fine line between adaptability, constantly shifting forms to avoid danger, and the fear of losing his sense of self. In his creations, he finds stability—a rare sense of control in an otherwise uncertain existence. His changeling nature reflects his belief that identity is fluid, but there is always a core truth to be discovered. 

Background: Urchin 

Growing up alone, Lyle lived a life of self-reliance, scavenging for food and repurposing discarded tools to survive. His years on the streets gave him a keen understanding of how to navigate urban landscapes, avoid danger, and remain unseen when necessary. As a changeling, his ability to shift personas was invaluable in blending into different environments. This gave him a unique perspective on both human nature and social structures, which he manipulates with his clever mind and tools. 

Despite his urban upbringing, Lyle is adept at living off the land, particularly in environments similar to his hometown near the dark forest. His early experiences of fear and survival in the wilderness influence his cautious yet inventive nature. 

Physical Description: 

Lyle is a changeling, a being whose true form is hard to pin down. When in his natural form, his features are pale and smooth, almost blank, with bright, inquisitive eyes that hint at a depth of intelligence and creativity. His build is wiry and lithe, a result of his years spent sneaking through alleys and evading trouble on the streets. 

However, Lyle rarely remains in his true form. He often shifts between personas, appearing as a human, half-elf, or dwarf depending on the situation. Each persona is meticulously crafted to blend in and serve a purpose, whether it’s gaining trust, evading suspicion, or simply avoiding unwanted attention. 

Lyle's attire is a practical mix of street urchin resourcefulness and artificer precision. He wears a patchwork cloak that seems haphazard but is filled with hidden pockets and compartments for his tools. His hands are often stained with grease or soot from his tinkering, and his trusty clockwork rabbit is always sitting nearby, watching with unblinking eyes. 

Skills and Personality: 

Lyle’s years of living on the streets have made him highly observant and resourceful. His natural curiosity is paired with a practical, no-nonsense approach to problem-solving, particularly through his skills as an artificer. He is proficient in Arcana, Investigation, and Tinker's Tools, using his knowledge of the arcane and mechanical to create unique inventions, traps, or tools. 

Lyle is not a natural leader and prefers to work in the background, relying on his inventions and gadgets rather than charisma to influence events. His low social confidence makes him somewhat reserved and distrustful of strangers, but those who earn his trust discover a fiercely loyal companion who will go to great lengths to protect his chosen family. 

His changeling nature gives him proficiency in Deception and Sleight of Hand, skills that allow him to navigate social challenges and avoid danger. He’s skilled at improvisation, often using his mechanical creations to solve problems in unexpected ways. 

Fears and Motivations: 

- Fear of Losing His True Self: Lyle is constantly shifting between different personas, a survival mechanism he developed during his orphaned years. However, this constant change has led to a deep-seated fear that one day he will lose track of who he truly is. His changeling abilities, while useful, also represent a struggle between adaptability and identity. This fear drives him to remain in control of his personas, always anchoring himself with small reminders of his true form. 
    
- Fear of Discovering His Parents Were Villains: Lyle’s search for the truth about his parents is driven by more than just curiosity—it’s tinged with fear. He worries that his parents, far from being the heroes they seemed, may have been deluded or even dangerous. This fear makes him question his own moral compass, especially as he uncovers more about their past and their involvement in the dark forest. 
    

Companion: 

Lyle is always accompanied by his clockwork jack rabbit, an invention from his childhood that has been upgraded over the years. The rabbitcan carry messages, deliver small items, and even serve as a lookout, its mechanical eyes scanning for danger. It represents Lyle’s creativity and resilience, a tangible reminder of his resourcefulness and the first step on his path as an artificer. 

Lyle Hartman is a character shaped by a life of survival, invention, and the constant search for truth. His changeling nature makes him a master of adaptation, while his artificer skills allow him to create unique solutions to the challenges he faces. As he ventures into the wider world, his fears, ingenuity, and quest for answers will guide his journey.

Morning Day 2 cloudy overcast

Nothing out of the ordinary walking into Barovia in regards to the woods surrounding.

Made it barovia west side has rows of houses 
center road goes into town center. Looks just about abandoned, buildings are boarded up sad looking. Barovia has no hedges or gates. 

One old lady on the west side. some chimney smoke. Center of town there are 3 main buildings, two of which have lights on(Building 1 and 2)
Faye took real initiative with hearing about the old lady and thought it was like a retreat she was on.

Old lady (Morgantha)- wooden cart blanked, hunched over dark robes rubbed in the dirt grey hair, walking away from us. Faye shouts at the old lady I hear shuffling noise in the building. 
The old lady walks up to the noise and she knocks on the door and she tries to sell him something, he buys something from her, glowing silvery bottle. Trades her tonic for memories, happiness she says its her trade secret and she claims she's a powerful wizard. 

She says to go to the inn and let the magic take you. School is haunted.

We defeat the mushroom man that came out pretty easily. Xyrlee pokes his head into the room and he notices a basic room with lots of smells. Can see there is a remnants of where the mushroom man was living in the room. 

Ismark says the mushroom people are newer. 

Head west out of the town. We see [[Kolyan Indirovich]] estate. looks like it could have been nicer in a former life but now look more run down. No panes of glass in windows or doors. Every opening has wood nailed from inside. Ismark makes a code of knocks on the door and says Ireena "its me open up". 

Ireena - tall, red hair, large jacket over clothing. 

The estate looks dusty and neglected. carving of holy symbols (we know of them but not specifically, we may recognize the morning lord sunrise, Selune moon symbol) along the walls.

Fathers study
- 3 bed rolls in study, large desk, coffin open with [[Kolyan Indirovich]] laying in the coffin. 

- Took [[Ismark Colionovich]] Jacket. 
- Faye walks away with Ireena and found 2 bite marks on Ireena.

- xyrlee finds a book called the adventures of woldolf van ricton 

going up to the north end of town going to the chapel at building 6, Iron fence around the church. Lights coming from within. 
Father Donovich, big open room with benches to sit on. Has a mosaic of the morning lord with sun burst for the face. Donovich sitting on one of the benches. 

Donovich son is Doru and lives under the church. 

Back room with marble slab that has iron grate and fire underneath it. 
I received a small book from Donothan, inside is a dark drawing of Doru. 

Rumors that vistani can come and go and may bring in others. Knew one guy who gave the Vistani and got them out. Some people say that even after you die you can't leave. Ismark doesn't trust others in the other towns. Or really know any of them. 

Burning bodies is typical, bodies used to come back.

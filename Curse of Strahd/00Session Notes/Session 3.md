- **Session 3 Recap**: We defeated the mushroom man, and Xyrlee noticed a basic room with remnants of the mushroom man's living space. Ismark mentioned that the mushroom people are newer.
- **Exploring the Town**: We headed west out of the town and saw the Kolyan Indirovich estate, which looked run down and neglected, however could have looked nice in its prime. Ismark made a code of knocks on the door, and Ireena answered, wearing a large jacket over her clothing.
- **The Estate**: The estate had dusty and neglected conditions, with carvings of holy symbols along the walls. We found a study with 3 bed rolls, a large desk, and a coffin with Kolyan Indirovich's body inside. I took Ireena's jacket, Faye went with Ireena to change into a chest plate so we can go move Kolyan's body, she noticed that Ireena has two bite marks on her neck and Xyrlee found a book called "The Adventures of Woldolf Van Ricton."
- **The Chapel**: We went to the chapel at building 6, which had an iron fence and lights coming from within. [[Father Donovich]] was sitting on a bench, and we heard his son Doru yelling (Known vampire), who lives under the church. We also found a back room with a marble slab and an iron grate with a fire underneath it. This is where we cremated Kolyan.
- **Conversation with Ismark**: We heard rumors that Vistani can come and go, bringing others with them. Some people believe that even after death, you can't leave. Ismark doesn't trust others in other towns, and we don't know anyone from other towns. Burning bodies is a common practice, and bodies have been known to come back.
- **Helping Donothan**: I messaged Donothan that I might be able to help him move on from losing his son and giving him a chance to say good bye one more time. He thought about it then gave me an hand drawn picture of his son and said its never to late for find the morning lord.

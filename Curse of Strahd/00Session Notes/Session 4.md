Ceremony is over and we all head out to the cemetery. 

Faye is off quickly to the school. 

## Donovich
-  Doru wanted to leave and was supposed to take over the church
- may have fell with a bad group, too close to the castle, gone for many days, Strahd brought him back to show him. 
- Vampiers 
- Stahd bit and killed him 3 days later returned as what he is now. If he allowed Doru to drink human blood he would become stronger. Could kill and bury within 3 days. 
- Doru may have just been in the wrong place and the church was full and may have also provoked Strahd to send a message. 

## Town Center
- Store Bilgath Mercantiles- 
- has normal very basic items
- has an item in the back 
- it is an old fancy looking book 


## School
- one room school house
- dusty wet tired. but it has overgrowth with mushrooms. 
- We open the school up and start fighting a mushroom man and a big spider (creepy white and large.) Spider took damage from Wayne's radiant blast. Mushroom man took a shot from me and looks bloody. Starting back on my round when we come back.

 Setting: Barovia, a dark and foreboding land filled with terrifying creatures such as spiders, ghouls, and werewolves. The presence of these creatures is well-known, though finding werewolves is notoriously difficult. 
    
- Vampires: Vampires are extremely rare, and we may not know about them yet. Their existence is more myth than reality to most, shrouded in mystery and superstition. 
    
- Strahd: At this point, we do not know about Strahd or his connection to Barovia. 
    
- Populated Area: We will be starting in a populated region, where there will be plenty of opportunities for social interactions. This includes mingling with townsfolk, forming alliances, or learning from locals. 
    
- Magic: Magic is allowed and accepted in Barovia, though it may still be viewed with some suspicion by more superstitious residents. 
    
- Backgrounds and Fears: Each character's background can play an important role in the campaign. We are all from somewhere else, bringing personal fears or traumas that will influence our journey. Ties to others, whether familial or through shared history, will shape our connections and motivations. 
    
- Magic Item: Each character may begin with a magic item that is personally significant, potentially tied to our backstories or a family heirloom. 
    
- Races: Humans and Elves are the most common races in Barovia, though other races may also be present. Our characters will blend into this mix, coming from various origins to interact with the world around us.

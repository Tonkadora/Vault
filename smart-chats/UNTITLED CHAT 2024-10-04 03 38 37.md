based on my notes who is lyle

##### assistant
Based on your notes, Lyle Hartman is a character in your campaign. He is a Changeling Artificer (Battle Smith) with a background as an Orphaned Changeling and a Street Survivor and Inventor. He is driven by a need for self-preservation, creative expression, and the quest for truth about his lineage. Lyle is constantly shifting between different personas, a survival mechanism he developed during his orphaned years, and this constant change has led to a deep-seated fear that one day he will lose track of who he truly is. He is also afraid of discovering that his parents, far from being the heroes they seemed, may have been deluded or even dangerous.

what are his personas

##### assistant
Based on your notes, Lyle Hartman has at least two personas:

1. "Russel Rightly" - a nerdy, annoying child who is a know-it-all. He speaks rapidly, peppering his speech with big words and obscure facts. Pip is a precocious 10-year-old with thick glasses and a bowtie.
2. (No other personas are mentioned in the notes, but it is mentioned that Lyle often shifts between different personas, so there may be others not listed here.)

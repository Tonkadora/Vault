**I. Introduction (10 minutes)**

1. Introduce the concept of arcs in animation.
2. Explain how arcs can be used to create more natural and engaging movements.
3. Show examples of animations that use arcs effectively.

**II. Understanding Arcs (20 minutes)**

1. Open Adobe Animate and create a new project.
2. Explain the concept of arcs in animation:
	* An arc is a smooth, curved motion that is used to create a sense of natural movement.
	* Arcs can be used to create a variety of movements, including:
		+ Linear motion (e.g. a character walking)
		+ Curved motion (e.g. a character turning)
		+ Rotational motion (e.g. a character spinning)
3. Demonstrate how to create arcs in Adobe Animate:
	* Use the "Ease" feature to create smooth, curved motions.
	* Use the "Bezier" tool to create custom arcs.

**III. Creating Examples (30 minutes)**

1. **Example 1: Linear Motion with an Arc**
	* Create a new project and draw a character shape.
	* Set the frame rate to 24 FPS.
	* Animate the character walking using a linear motion with an arc.
2. **Example 2: Curved Motion with an Arc**
	* Create a new project and draw a character shape.
	* Set the frame rate to 24 FPS.
	* Animate the character turning using a curved motion with an arc.
3. **Example 3: Rotational Motion with an Arc**
	* Create a new project and draw a character shape.
	* Set the frame rate to 24 FPS.
	* Animate the character spinning using a rotational motion with an arc.

**IV. Practice Time (20 minutes)**

1. Provide students with the following prompts:
	* Create an animation of a character jumping using a linear motion with an arc.
	* Animate a ball rolling down a hill using a curved motion with an arc.
	* Create an animation of a character spinning around a central axis using a rotational motion with an arc.
2. Allow students to work on their projects, providing guidance and support as needed.

**V. Conclusion (10 minutes)**

1. Review the concept of arcs in animation.
2. Ask students to share their projects and discuss how they used arcs to create more natural and engaging movements.
3. Provide feedback and encouragement.

**Assessment:**

* Observe students during the practice time and provide feedback on their use of arcs.
* Review their projects and provide feedback on their understanding of the concept.

**Extension:**

* Have students create a more complex animation that incorporates multiple elements, such as characters, backgrounds, and special effects.
* Encourage students to experiment with different types of arcs, such as:
	+ Using multiple arcs to create a more complex motion.
	+ Using arcs to create a sense of weight or mass.

**Prompts for Students:**

1. Create an animation of a character flying through the air using a linear motion with an arc.
2. Animate a car driving around a corner using a curved motion with an arc.
3. Create an animation of a character spinning around a central axis using a rotational motion with an arc.
4. Animate a ball bouncing off a wall using a combination of linear and curved motions with arcs.
5. Create an animation of a character walking up a hill using a combination of linear and curved motions with arcs.

**Tips for Teachers:**

* Encourage students to experiment and try new things.
* Provide guidance and support as needed.
* Emphasize the importance of understanding the concept of arcs in animation.
* Encourage students to share their projects and provide feedback.

**I. Introduction (10 minutes)**

1. Introduce the two main animation principles: straight ahead and pose to pose.
2. Explain how these principles can be used to create more efficient and effective animations.
3. Show examples of animations that use each principle.

**II. Understanding Straight Ahead Animation (20 minutes)**

1. Open Adobe Animate and create a new project.
2. Explain the straight ahead animation principle:
	* This principle involves animating a scene from start to finish, without planning out the individual poses.
	* The animator works from one frame to the next, making adjustments as needed.
3. Demonstrate how to use straight ahead animation to create a simple animation, such as a character walking or a ball bouncing.
4. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of straight ahead animation:
	* Advantages: Can be more intuitive and spontaneous, allows for more freedom in the animation process.
	* Disadvantages: Can be more time-consuming and difficult to achieve a consistent look.

**III. Understanding Pose to Pose Animation (20 minutes)**

1. Explain the pose to pose animation principle:
	* This principle involves planning out the individual poses of a scene and then filling in the animation between them.
	* The animator creates a series of keyframes, which are then connected by the animation software.
2. Demonstrate how to use pose to pose animation to create a more complex animation, such as a character running or a car driving.
3. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of pose to pose animation:
	* Advantages: Can be more efficient and easier to achieve a consistent look.
	* Disadvantages: Can be more time-consuming to plan out the individual poses.

**IV. Creating Examples (30 minutes)**

1. **Example 1: Straight Ahead Animation**
	* Create a new project and draw a character shape.
	* Set the frame rate to 24 FPS.
	* Animate the character walking using the straight ahead principle.
2. **Example 2: Pose to Pose Animation**
	* Create a new project and draw a car shape.
	* Set the frame rate to 24 FPS.
	* Plan out the individual poses of the car driving and then fill in the animation between them using the pose to pose principle.

**V. Practice Time (20 minutes)**

1. Provide students with the following prompts:
	* Create an animation of a character jumping using the straight ahead principle.
	* Animate a ball rolling down a hill using the pose to pose principle.
	* Create an animation of a character running using a combination of both principles.
2. Allow students to work on their projects, providing guidance and support as needed.

**VI. Conclusion (10 minutes)**

1. Review the two main animation principles: straight ahead and pose to pose.
2. Ask students to share their projects and discuss how they used each principle to create their animations.
3. Provide feedback and encouragement.

**Assessment:**

* Observe students during the practice time and provide feedback on their use of the two animation principles.
* Review their projects and provide feedback on their understanding of the principles.

**Extension:**

* Have students create a more complex animation that incorporates multiple elements, such as characters, backgrounds, and special effects.
* Encourage students to experiment with different animation techniques, such as:
	+ Using a combination of straight ahead and pose to pose animation.
	+ Using different frame rates and animation speeds.

**Prompts for Students:**

1. Create an animation of a character dancing using a combination of straight ahead and pose to pose animation.
2. Animate a car driving through a city using the pose to pose principle.
3. Create an animation of a character flying through the air using the straight ahead principle.
4. Animate a ball bouncing off a wall using a combination of both principles.
5. Create an animation of a character running through a forest using the pose to pose principle.

**Tips for Teachers:**

* Encourage students to experiment and try new things.
* Provide guidance and support as needed.
* Emphasize the importance of understanding the two main animation principles.
* Encourage students to share their projects and provide feedback.

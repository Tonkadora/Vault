**I. Introduction (10 minutes)**

1. Introduce the concept of squash and stretch in animation.
2. Explain how squash and stretch can be used to create a sense of weight, mass, and realism in an animation.
3. Show examples of animations that effectively use squash and stretch.

**II. Understanding Squash and Stretch (20 minutes)**

1. Open Adobe Animate and create a new project.
2. Explain the principles of squash and stretch:
    - Squash: The deformation of an object when it is subjected to force, causing it to compress or flatten.
    - Stretch: The deformation of an object when it is subjected to force, causing it to elongate or stretch.
3. Demonstrate how to apply squash and stretch to different types of objects, such as:
    - A ball bouncing: Squash the ball as it hits the ground, and stretch it as it bounces back up.
    - A character jumping: Squash the character's legs as they hit the ground, and stretch them as they jump back up.
    - A rubber band: Stretch the rubber band as it is pulled, and squash it as it is released.

**III. Creating Examples (30 minutes)**

1. **Example 1: A Ball Bouncing**
    - Create a new project and draw a ball shape.
    - Set the frame rate to 24 FPS.
    - Animate the ball bouncing up and down, using squash and stretch to create a sense of weight and mass.
2. **Example 2: A Character Jumping**
    - Create a new project and draw a character shape.
    - Set the frame rate to 24 FPS.
    - Animate the character jumping, using squash and stretch to create a sense of movement and weight.
3. **Example 3: A Rubber Band Stretching**
    - Create a new project and draw a rubber band shape.
    - Set the frame rate to 24 FPS.
    - Animate the rubber band stretching and releasing, using squash and stretch to create a sense of tension and release.

**IV. Practice Time (20 minutes)**

1. Provide students with the following prompts:
    - Create an animation of a character falling, using squash and stretch to create a sense of weight and mass.
    - Animate a ball rolling down a hill, using squash and stretch to create a sense of movement and weight.
    - Create an animation of a rubber band snapping, using squash and stretch to create a sense of tension and release.
2. Allow students to work on their projects, providing guidance and support as needed.

**V. Conclusion (10 minutes)**

1. Review the principles of squash and stretch in animation.
2. Ask students to share their projects and discuss how they used squash and stretch to create more realistic and engaging animations.
3. Provide feedback and encouragement.

**Assessment:**

- Observe students during the practice time and provide feedback on their use of squash and stretch.
- Review their projects and provide feedback on their understanding of the principles.

**Extension:**

- Have students create a more complex animation that incorporates multiple elements, such as characters, backgrounds, and special effects.
- Encourage students to experiment with different types of squash and stretch, such as:
    - Squash and stretch in 3D space
    - Squash and stretch with different materials (e.g. rubber, metal, fabric)

**Prompts for Students:**

1. Create an animation of a character walking, using squash and stretch to create a sense of movement and weight.
2. Animate a ball rolling across a surface, using squash and stretch to create a sense of movement and weight.
3. Create an animation of a rubber band stretching and releasing, using squash and stretch to create a sense of tension and release.
4. Animate a character running, using squash and stretch to create a sense of movement and weight.
5. Create an animation of a ball bouncing off a wall, using squash and stretch to create a sense of weight and mass.

**Tips for Teachers:**

- Encourage students to experiment and try new things.
- Provide guidance and support as needed.
- Emphasize the importance of squash and stretch in creating more realistic and engaging animations.
- Encourage students to share their projects and provide feedback.

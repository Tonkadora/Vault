Â **Introduction (10 minutes)**

1. Introduce the concept of timing and speed in animation.
2. Explain how timing and speed can be used to create a sense of drama, tension, or excitement in an animation.
3. Show examples of animations that effectively use timing and speed.

**II. Understanding Timing and Speed in Adobe Animate (20 minutes)**

1. Open Adobe Animate and create a new project.
2. Explain the different types of timing and speed in Adobe Animate:
    - Frame rate: The number of frames per second (FPS) that an animation plays at.
    - Timeline: A visual representation of the animation's timing and speed.
    - Keyframes: Markers that indicate specific points in the timeline where changes occur.
3. Demonstrate how to set the frame rate and adjust the timeline to control the animation's timing and speed.

**III. Creating Examples (30 minutes)**

1. **Example 1: A Ball Bouncing**
    - Create a new project and draw a ball shape.
    - Set the frame rate to 24 FPS.
    - Create a timeline with 10 keyframes, spaced evenly apart.
    - Animate the ball bouncing up and down, using the keyframes to control the timing and speed.
2. **Example 2: A Character Walking**
    - Create a new project and draw a character shape.
    - Set the frame rate to 24 FPS.
    - Create a timeline with 10 keyframes, spaced evenly apart.
    - Animate the character walking, using the keyframes to control the timing and speed.
3. **Example 3: A Clock Ticking**
    - Create a new project and draw a clock shape.
    - Set the frame rate to 24 FPS.
    - Create a timeline with 10 keyframes, spaced evenly apart.
    - Animate the clock ticking, using the keyframes to control the timing and speed.

**IV. Practice Time (20 minutes)**

1. Provide students with the following prompts:
    - Create an animation of a car driving down a road, using timing and speed to create a sense of movement.
    - Animate a character jumping over an obstacle, using timing and speed to create a sense of excitement.
    - Create an animation of a clock ticking, using timing and speed to create a sense of urgency.
2. Allow students to work on their projects, providing guidance and support as needed.

**V. Conclusion (10 minutes)**

1. Review the concepts of timing and speed in Adobe Animate.
2. Ask students to share their projects and discuss how they used timing and speed to create engaging animations.
3. Provide feedback and encouragement.

**Assessment:**

- Observe students during the practice time and provide feedback on their use of timing and speed.
- Review their projects and provide feedback on their understanding of the concepts.

**Extension:**

- Have students create a more complex animation that incorporates multiple elements, such as characters, backgrounds, and special effects.
- Encourage students to experiment with different frame rates and timelines to create unique effects.

**Prompts for Students:**

1. Create an animation of a character dancing, using timing and speed to create a sense of rhythm.
2. Animate a clock melting, using timing and speed to create a sense of urgency.
3. Create an animation of a car crashing, using timing and speed to create a sense of drama.
4. Animate a character flying through the air, using timing and speed to create a sense of weightlessness.
5. Create an animation of a clock ticking, using timing and speed to create a sense of monotony.

**Tips for Teachers:**

- Encourage students to experiment and try new things.
- Provide guidance and support as needed.
- Emphasize the importance of timing and speed in creating engaging animations.
- Encourage students to share their projects and provide feedback.
